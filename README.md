## 1. Introduction

The Decentralized Flipkart Clone is a decentralized e-commerce platform built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to mint their products as NFTs and enables purchasing using a stable coin called Flipkart Super Coin. The project is composed of two main components: smart contracts (Solidity) for the backend and a React-based frontend for user interaction.

## 2. Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following tools and accounts set up:

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) with testnet accounts and ETH for gas fees
- Git

## 3. Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
https://github.com/Balamurugan-Nagarajan/flipkartWeb3
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## 4. Smart Contracts

The smart contracts are written in Solidity and handle the core functionalities of the project: minting NFTs and processing purchases with Flipkart Super Coin.

### Contracts Overview:

- `FlipkartNFT.sol`: Manages NFT minting and ownership.
- `FlipkartSuperCoin.sol`: Implements the stable coin used for purchases.

### Compile Contracts:

Compile the smart contracts using Hardhat:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

### Deploy Contracts:

Deploy the contracts to a local or testnet network by updating the `hardhat.config.js` with network configurations. Deploy using the following command:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network-name>
```

## 5. Frontend

The frontend is built using React and interacts with the smart contracts using Ethers.js. It allows users to mint NFTs and purchase items using Flipkart Super Coin.

### Frontend Components:

- `MintForm.jsx`: Allows users to mint their products as NFTs.
- `Marketplace.jsx`: Displays the available NFTs for purchase using Flipkart Super Coin.

### Run Frontend:

Start the React development server:

```bash
npm start
```

## 6. Usage

1. **Mint NFTs**: Connect your Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) and navigate to the Mint page. Fill in the details of your product and mint it as an NFT.

2. **Purchase with Flipkart Super Coin**: Explore the Marketplace page, select an NFT you want to purchase, and click the "Purchase" button. Confirm the transaction in your wallet.

## 7. Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully set up and documented the Decentralized Flipkart Clone project. Users can now mint their products as NFTs and purchase items using Flipkart Super Coin, all within a decentralized environment.

Remember that this documentation provides a simplified overview of the project. In a real-world scenario, you would need to consider security, testing, scalability, and user experience enhancements.

# Decentralized Stable Coin Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the Decentralized Stable Coin project, a protocol that includes a stable coin contract and a stable coin engine. The stable coin is designed to maintain relative stability by being algorithmically minted and pegged to the USD. This documentation will guide you through the setup, components, and functionality of the protocol.

7. Conclusion

## 1. Introduction

The Decentralized Stable Coin project presents a protocol that uses algorithmic minting and a collateralized mechanism to maintain the value of a stable coin, which is pegged to the USD. The project consists of two main components: the stable coin contract and the stable coin engine. These components work together to achieve the protocol's goals.

## 2. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools and accounts set up:

- Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) with testnet accounts and ETH for gas fees
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Git

## 3. Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
https://github.com/Balamurugan-Nagarajan/FlipkartStableCoin
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## 4. Stable Coin Contract

The stable coin contract is written in Solidity and defines the behavior and properties of the stable coin.

### Contract Features:

- Algorithmic minting and burning to maintain stability.
- Collateralized by WETH and WBTC.
- Pegged to the USD.

### Compile and Deploy Contract:

Compile and deploy the stable coin contract using Foundry:

```bash
npx foundry compile
npx foundry deploy
```

## 5. Stable Coin Engine

The stable coin engine is responsible for executing the protocol's stability mechanisms, including minting and burning tokens based on price fluctuations.

### Engine Components:

- `PriceOracle.sol`: Fetches the current price of collateral assets (WETH, WBTC).
- `StabilityMechanism.sol`: Implements the algorithmic minting and burning logic.

### Compile and Deploy Engine:

Compile and deploy the stable coin engine components using Foundry:

```bash
npx foundry compile-engine
npx foundry deploy-engine
```

## 6. Usage

1. **Minting and Burning**: Users can interact with the stable coin contract to mint stable coins by depositing collateral and burn stable coins to release collateral.

2. **Price Oracle**: The protocol's stability mechanism relies on accurate price data from the price oracle to determine minting and burning thresholds.

## 7. Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully set up the Decentralized Stable Coin protocol, complete with a stable coin contract and an engine for algorithmic stability maintenance. This documentation provides an overview, but keep in mind that the real-world implementation should undergo thorough testing, security audits, and continuous refinement.

By creating this decentralized stable coin, you're contributing to the innovative landscape of blockchain-based finance and commerce.
